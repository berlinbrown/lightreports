 * <p>Date: 1/5/2009 7/15/2009 - Added Clojure 1.0, other performance fixes and cleanups.
 *
 * <p>Main Description: Light Log Viewer is a tool for making it easier to search log files. Light
 * Log Viewer adds some text highlighting, quick key navigation to text files, simple graphs and
 * charts for monitoring logs, file database to quickly navigate to files of interest, and HTML to
 * PDF convert tool. Light Log was developed with a combination of Clojure 1.0, Java and Scala with
 * use of libs, SWT 3.4, JFreeChart, iText.
 *
 * <p>Quickstart : the best way to run the Light Log viewer is to click on the win32 batch script
 * light_logs.bat (you may need to edit the Linux script for Unix/Linux environments). Edit the
 * win32 script to add more heap memory or other parameters.
 *
 * <p>The clojure source is contained in : HOME/src/octane The java source is contained in :
 * HOME/src/java/src
 *
 * <p>To build the java source, see : HOME/src/java/build.xml and build_pdf_gui.xml
 *
 * <p>Metrics: (as of 7/15/2009) Light Log Viewer consists of 6500 lines of Clojure code, and
 * contains wrapper code around the Java source. There are 2000+ lines of Java code in the Java
 * library for Light Log Viewer.
 *
 * <p>Additional Development Notes: The SWT gui and other libraries are launched from a dynamic
 * classloader. Clojure is also started from the same code, and reflection is used to dynamically
 * initiate Clojure. See the 'start' package. The binary code is contained in the octane_start.jar
 * library.
